## Sliding Window Technique

Sliding window is a computational technique that aims to reduce the use of nested loops and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity. It is used to solve problems that involve arrays, strings, subarrays, substrings, largest sum, maximum sum, and minimum sum.

### Example of Code



### What kinds of Problems it means to be solved with Sliding Window Technique?

- Maximum Subarray Problem: Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array.
- Minimum Window Substring: Find the smallest substring that contains all unique characters from a given string.
- Distinct Subarrays: Find the number of distinct subarrays in an array.
- Maximum Frequency Character: Find the character that appears the most times in a given substring.
- Anagrams: finding all anagrams in a string.
